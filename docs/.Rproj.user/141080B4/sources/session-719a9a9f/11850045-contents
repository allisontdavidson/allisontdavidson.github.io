Themes are going to be helpful to adjust the default. There are built-in themes already available - but you can also adjust specific elements.

# Globally set a theme

To globally set a theme, use theme_set( ) in an R Chunk. All subsequent graphs will use that theme as default.

## Global Theme Example

```{r}
theme_set(theme_bw())

gf_point(mpg~disp, data = mtcars)
```

# Manually set a theme

To manually set a theme, use the gf_theme( ) layer on any plot.

## Manual theme example

```{r}
gf_point(mpg~disp, data = mtcars) %>%
  gf_theme(theme_minimal())
```

# All ggplot themes

Here is a [list](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html) of all themes available and a preview of what they look like.

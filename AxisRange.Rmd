This section looks at ways of adjusting the overall scale of each axis (e.g. instead of going from 0 to 100 going from 40 to 60) as well as reversing the order (e.g. instead of going from 1 to 100 going from 100 to 1).

# Adjusting Axis Range

## Beyond the Data Range

If you are adjusting the axis range beyond the data - you can use the gf_lims( ) command to adjust.  This is most helpful when you're trying to match axis to compare.

**Example:** gf_lims(x=c(0,10), y = c(10,100))


```{r, include = FALSE}
# Read in data
lengths = read.delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JedStephens/Handbook-of-Small-Data-Sets/master/LENGTHS.DAT", header = FALSE)

# Formatting data -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Add a new variable to describe the units the students were using (meter or ft)
lengths = lengths %>%
  mutate(Unit = c(rep("Meter", 3), rep("Feet", 5))) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 1:15, names_to = "DummyV", values_to = "GuessedLength", values_drop_na = TRUE)

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Visualization 
# *************

# Max feet = 94 which is equivalent to 28.65 meters
# Max meters = 40 which is equivalent to 131 feet.

# Feet Graph
```

The following dotplots are OK, but it might be helpful to match up the equivalent feet to meter measurement so the 43 ft and 13.1 meters align.

```{r}
feetDefault = gf_dotplot(~GuessedLength, data = subset(lengths, Unit == "Feet"), binwidth = 1, alpha = 0.3) %>%
  gf_labs(x = "Guessed Feet", title = "Guessed Feet", y = NULL) %>%
  gf_vline(xintercept = 43, alpha = 0.7, linetype = "dashed") %>%
  gf_text(x = 44, y = .75, label = "Actual Length = 43 ft", hjust = -0.1, size = 4) %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) 

# Meter graph

meterDefault = gf_dotplot(~GuessedLength, data=subset(lengths, Unit == "Meter"), binwidth = 0.5, alpha = 0.3) %>%
  gf_labs(x = "Guessed Meters", title = "Guessed Meters", y = NULL) %>%
  gf_vline(xintercept = 13.1, alpha = 0.7, linetype = "dashed") %>%
  gf_text( x = 14, y = .75, label = "Actual Length = 13.1 m", hjust=-0.1, size = 4) %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank())

grid.arrange(feetDefault, meterDefault, nrow = 2)
```

In the dotplots below, the axis are adjusted so they span the same equivalent space.  It is more clear that the 43 ft = 13.1 meters.

```{r}
feet = gf_dotplot(~GuessedLength, data = subset(lengths, Unit == "Feet"), binwidth = 2, alpha = 0.3) %>%
  gf_labs(x = "Guessed Feet", title = "Guessed Feet: Adjusted", y = NULL) %>%
  gf_lims(x = c(0, 147)) %>%
  gf_vline(xintercept = 43, alpha = 0.7, linetype = "dashed") %>%
  gf_text(x = 44, y = .75, label = "Actual Length = 43 ft", hjust = -0.1, size = 4) %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) 

# Meter graph

meter = gf_dotplot(~GuessedLength, data=subset(lengths, Unit == "Meter"), binwidth = 0.5, alpha = 0.3) %>%
  gf_labs(x = "Guessed Meters", title = "Guessed Meters: Adjusted", y = NULL) %>%
  gf_refine(coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 45))) %>%
  gf_vline(xintercept = 13.1, alpha = 0.7, linetype = "dashed") %>%
  gf_text( x = 14, y = .75, label = "Actual Length = 13.1 m", hjust=-0.1, size = 4) %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank())

grid.arrange(feet, meter, nrow = 2)
```

## Within Data Range

If we are adjusting axis within the range of data, we need to be careful what we do with points that fall outside that range.  For example, do we want to just ignore them and zoom in or do we want to essentially omit them from the dataset/consideration.  

There are 2 ways of adjusting axis scales (in terms of how they treat data). One way is called "without clipping" where all data is preserved, but we adjust the axis to essentially zoom in or out while keeping all data preserved. Alternatively, we can adjust "with clipping" where all data not in the area specified is no longer accounted for. This will matter if you're overlaying things like linear model trendlines. The images below come from the ggplot2 cheat-sheet and I think illustrate things well.

![No Clipping](NoClipping.jpg) ![With Clipping](WithClipping.jpg)

### Adjust Scales Without Clipping

To adjust scales without removing unseen data points, use a gf_refine( ) statement with coord_cartesian( ) specifications.

**Example:** gf_plot( ) %\>% gf_refine(coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 100), ylim = c(10, 20)))

![No Clipping](NoClipping.jpg)

```{r}
original = gf_point(Salary~Age, data = SalaryGender, color = ~as.factor(PhD)) %>%
  gf_labs(color = "PhD", title = "All Data") %>%
  gf_refine(scale_color_discrete(labels = c("0" = "No PhD", "1" = "PhD"))) %>%
  gf_lm() %>%
  gf_theme(guides(color = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE))) %>%
  gf_theme(legend.position = c(0.2, 0.9))

noclipping = gf_point(Salary~Age, data = SalaryGender, color = ~as.factor(PhD)) %>%
  gf_labs(color = "PhD", title = "Zoom In Without Clipping") %>%
  gf_refine(
    scale_color_discrete(labels = c("0" = "No PhD", "1" = "PhD")),
    coord_cartesian(xlim = c(40, 80))) %>%
  gf_lm() %>%
  gf_theme(guides(color = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE))) %>%
  gf_theme(legend.position = c(0.2, 0.9))

grid.arrange(original, noclipping, nrow = 1)
```

### Adjust Scales With Clipping

There are a few ways you can adjust the scales with clipping. For example, you can merely create a subset and only use that data (by default, clipping out the other data). Alternatively you can use a gf_lims( ) command OR a scale_x_continuous( ) command within a refine statement.

![With Clipping](WithClipping.jpg)

**Option 1:** gf_lims(x = c(40,80)) or gf_lims(x = c(65, NA), y = c(3, NA))

**Option 2:** gf_refine(scale_x_continuous(limits = c(40,80)))

```{r, warning = FALSE}
clipping1 = gf_point(Salary~Age, data = SalaryGender, color = ~as.factor(PhD)) %>%
  gf_labs(color = "PhD", title = "Zoom In With Clipping", subtitle = "Using gf_lims()") %>%
  gf_refine(scale_color_discrete(labels = c("0" = "No PhD", "1" = "PhD"))) %>%
  gf_lm() %>%
  gf_lims(x = c(40,80)) %>%
  gf_theme(guides(color = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE))) %>%
  gf_theme(legend.position = c(0.2, 0.9))

grid.arrange(noclipping, clipping1, nrow = 1)

clipping2 = gf_point(Salary~Age, data = SalaryGender, color = ~as.factor(PhD)) %>%
  gf_labs(color = "PhD", title = "Zoom In With Clipping", subtitle = "Using gf_refine()") %>%
  gf_refine(
    scale_color_discrete(labels = c("0" = "No PhD", "1" = "PhD")),
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(40,80))) %>%
  gf_lm()%>%
  gf_theme(guides(color = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE))) %>%
  gf_theme(legend.position = c(0.2, 0.9))

grid.arrange(noclipping, clipping1, clipping2, nrow = 1)
```

## Adjusting Categorical Scales

Adjusting an axis if we have categorical data can be done the same way we adjust a no-clipping continuous axis, but have to realize that the first category on our x-axis is at 1. So the boxplot (below) has a default x-range from (1,2). If we want to have a wider range, we can spread to (0,3).

**Example:** gf_refine(coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,3)))

```{r}
SalaryGender$Gender = recode(SalaryGender$Gender, '0' = "Female", '1' = "Male")

noshift = gf_boxplot(Salary~Gender, data = SalaryGender, color = ~as.factor(PhD), width = 0.4, position= position_dodge(.5)) %>%
  gf_labs(color = "PhD", x = "Gender", title = "Default Range") %>%
  gf_refine(scale_color_discrete(labels = c("0" = "No PhD", "1" = "PhD"))) 

spread = gf_boxplot(Salary~Gender, data = SalaryGender, color = ~as.factor(PhD), width = 0.4, position= position_dodge(.5)) %>%
  gf_labs(color = "PhD", x = "Gender", title = "Spread X Axis Out") %>%
  gf_refine(scale_color_discrete(labels = c("0" = "No PhD", "1" = "PhD")),
    coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,3))) 

grid.arrange(noshift, spread, ncol = 1)

```

If you wanted to add a space for another label, one can be added through the scale_\*_discrete command.

**EXample:** scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Female", "Male", "Additional Label"))

```{r}
gf_boxplot(Salary~Gender, data = SalaryGender, color = ~as.factor(PhD), width = 0.4, position= position_dodge(.5)) %>%
  gf_labs(color = "PhD", x = "Gender", title = "Additional Label Added") %>%
  gf_refine(scale_color_discrete(labels = c("0" = "No PhD", "1" = "PhD")),
            scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Female", "Male", "Additional Label"))) 
```



## Exapanding Visual Range

In addition to all methods of adjusting the axis ranges, we can also adjust the plot field using the exapnd option in scale_\*\_continuous or scale_\*\_discrete.

**Example (discrete):** scale_x_discrete(expand = expansion(add = 2))

**Example (continuous):** scale_y_continuous(exapnd = expansion(add = 10))

```{r}
gf_boxplot(Salary~Gender, data = SalaryGender, color = ~as.factor(PhD), width = 0.4, position= position_dodge(.5)) %>%
  gf_labs(color = "PhD", x = "Gender", title = "Spread X & Y Axis Out") %>%
  gf_refine(scale_color_discrete(labels = c("0" = "No PhD", "1" = "PhD")),
            scale_x_discrete(expand = expansion(add = 2)),
            scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(add = 50)))
```

For more details, the [ggplot book](https://ggplot2-book.org/scales-position) also describes adjusting scales in a variety of ways.

# Breaks

To adjust scale breaks, use the breaks command inside the scale_XXX_continuous command.

Most breaks will likely be what are known as "major breaks" (the numbers on the axis).  One can also adjust the minor breaks (reference lines within the graph).  

## Adjust Major Breaks

A few ways to adjust major breaks include specifying a sequence of values (or other function of values), manually entering values, or specifying the width of the breaks.  Here are a few highlights to each of these methods:

**Sequence:** gf_refine(scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(seq(1:13))))

**Specific Values:** gf_refine(scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1950, 2000)))

**Specific width:** scale_x_continuous(breaks = breaks_width(2000))

**Specific width with offset:** scale_x_continuous(breaks = breaks_width(2000, offset = 100))

```{r}
gf_boxplot(Salary~Gender, data = SalaryGender, color = ~as.factor(PhD), width = 0.4, position= position_dodge(.5)) %>%
  gf_labs(color = "PhD", x = "Gender", title = "Breaks as Sequence") %>%
  gf_refine(
    scale_color_discrete(labels = c("0" = "No PhD", "1" = "PhD")),
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(seq(0,200, by = 20))))

gf_boxplot(Salary~Gender, data = SalaryGender, color = ~as.factor(PhD), width = 0.4, position= position_dodge(.5)) %>%
  gf_labs(color = "PhD", x = "Gender", title = "Breaks Specific Values") %>%
  gf_refine(
    scale_color_discrete(labels = c("0" = "No PhD", "1" = "PhD")),
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 100, 150)))

noOffset = gf_histogram(~price, data = diamonds) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Adjust Major Breaks", subtitle = "breaks_width: No offset", y = "") %>%
  gf_refine(scale_x_continuous(breaks = breaks_width(4000)),
            scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,7500,15000)))

offsetPos = gf_histogram(~price, data = diamonds) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Adjust Major Breaks", subtitle = "breaks_width with offset +500", y = "") %>%
  gf_refine(scale_x_continuous(breaks = breaks_width(4000, offset = 500)),
            scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,7500,15000)))

offsetNeg = gf_histogram(~price, data = diamonds) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Adjust Major Breaks", subtitle = "breaks_width with offset -500", y = "") %>%
  gf_refine(scale_x_continuous(breaks = breaks_width(4000, offset = -500)),
            scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,7500,15000)))

grid.arrange(noOffset, offsetPos, offsetNeg)
```

## Adjust Minor Breaks

```{r}
gf_histogram(~price, data = diamonds) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Adjust Minor Breaks (X Axis)", subtitle = "Specific Values", y = "") %>%
  gf_refine(scale_x_continuous(breaks = breaks_width(10000), minor_breaks = c(3000,7000,15000)),
            scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,7500,15000))) %>%
  gf_theme(theme_minimal())

gf_histogram(~price, data = diamonds) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Adjust Minor Breaks (Y Axis)", subtitle = "Sequence of Values", y = "") %>%
  gf_refine(scale_x_continuous(breaks = breaks_width(4000)),
            scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,7500,15000), minor_breaks = seq(0,20000, by = 2000))) %>%
  gf_theme(theme_minimal())

gf_histogram(~price, data = diamonds) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Adjust Minor Breaks (X Axis)", subtitle = "breaks_width", y = "") %>%
  gf_refine(scale_x_continuous(breaks = breaks_width(4000), minor_breaks = breaks_width(1000)),
            scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,7500,15000))) %>%
  gf_theme(theme_minimal())

gf_histogram(~price, data = diamonds) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Adjust Minor Breaks (Both Axis)", subtitle = "minor_breaks_n", y = "") %>%
  gf_refine(scale_x_continuous(breaks = breaks_width(4000), minor_breaks = minor_breaks_n(2)),
            scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,7500,15000), minor_breaks = minor_breaks_n(10))) %>%
  gf_theme(theme_minimal())
```

## Binned Scales

If you have numeric scales and want to bin the scales, there are a few ways you can approach this.  You can bin (or "cut") the data itself, manually create categories, or you can just bin the axis.  Examples can be found in the [ggplot](https://ggplot2-book.org/scales-position) book.


# Reverse Scales

Reversing scales will have different codes based on the type of data you have. The general code to reverse scales is:

**Continuous:** gf_refine( scale_y_reverse( ) )

**Discrete:** gf_refine( scale_y_discrete( limits = rev ) )


```{r}
original = gf_boxplot(Salary~Gender, data = SalaryGender, color = ~as.factor(PhD), width = 0.4, position= position_dodge(.5), show.legend = FALSE) %>%
  gf_labs(color = "PhD", x = "Gender", title = "Original") %>%
  gf_refine(
    scale_color_discrete(labels = c("0" = "No PhD", "1" = "PhD"))) 

y.reverse = gf_boxplot(Salary~Gender, data = SalaryGender, color = ~as.factor(PhD), width = 0.4, position= position_dodge(.5), show.legend = FALSE) %>%
  gf_labs(color = "PhD", x = "Gender", title = "Reverse Y", subtitle = "scale_y_reverse()", y = "Salary (reversed)") %>%
  gf_refine(
    scale_color_discrete(labels = c("0" = "No PhD", "1" = "PhD")),
    scale_y_reverse()) # Reverse Y axis continuous scale

grid.arrange(original, y.reverse, nrow = 1)

x.reverse = gf_boxplot(Salary~Gender, data = SalaryGender, color = ~as.factor(PhD), width = 0.4, position= position_dodge(.5), show.legend = FALSE) %>%
  gf_labs(color = "PhD", x = "Gender (reversed)", title = "Reverse X", subtitle = "scale_x_discrete(limits = rev)") %>%
  gf_refine(
    scale_color_discrete(labels = c("0" = "No PhD", "1" = "PhD")),
    scale_x_discrete(limits = rev)) # Reverse X axis discrete scale

grid.arrange(original, x.reverse, ncol = 1)

both.reverse = gf_boxplot(Salary~Gender, data = SalaryGender, color = ~as.factor(PhD), width = 0.4, position= position_dodge(.5), show.legend = FALSE) %>%
  gf_labs(color = "PhD", x = "Gender (reversed)", title = "Reverse Y and X", subtitle = "scale_y_reverse() &\nscale_x_discrete(limits = rev) ", y = "Salary (reversed)") %>%
  gf_refine(
    scale_color_discrete(labels = c("0" = "No PhD", "1" = "PhD")),
    scale_y_reverse(), # Reverse Y axis continuous scale
    scale_x_discrete(limits = rev)) # Reverse X axis discrete scale

grid.arrange(original, both.reverse, nrow = 1)

```

## Reverse Fill

The following example looks at a bargraph and different ways to reverse the fill categories and colors used to fill.

```{r}
gf_bar(~cut, data = diamonds) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Default Graph")

gf_bar(~cut, data = diamonds) %>%
  gf_refine(scale_x_discrete(limits = rev)) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Reverse X Axis")
```

**Reverse fill categories only:** fill = ~ fct_rev(Var)

**Reverse fill colors & categories:** scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, limits = rev)

**Reverse legend to match reversed fill & cateogeis:** gf_theme(guides(fill=guide_legend(reverse=TRUE)))

```{r, include=FALSE}
require(viridis)
```


```{r, warning=FALSE}
gf_bar(~cut, data = diamonds, fill = ~clarity) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Default Graph With Fill")

gf_bar(~cut, data = diamonds, fill = ~fct_rev(clarity)) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Reverse Fill Categories", subtitle = "Color Order The Same", fill = "clarity")


gf_bar(~cut, data = diamonds, fill = ~clarity) %>%
  gf_refine(scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, limits = rev)) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Reverse Color Order & Categories") 

gf_bar(~cut, data = diamonds, fill = ~clarity) %>%
  gf_refine(scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, limits = rev)) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Match Legend to Reverse Color Order ") %>%
  gf_theme(guides(fill=guide_legend(reverse=TRUE)))
```

# Order of Categories

We can adjust the default order of categories a few ways.

1.  We can manually specify the order of levels within a factor ([fct_relevel](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_relevel.html))
2.  We can have R order based on summary statistics ([fct_reorder](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_reorder.html))
3.  Order by Count ([fct_infreq](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_inorder.html))
4.  Order by Count but only display Top N ([fct_lump_n](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_lump.html))
5.  Reverse order of any factor ([fct_rev](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_rev.html))

A helpful package in ordering categorical variables is [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/index.html).  All ways of adjusting variable order described below utilize this package.  

## Manually specify order

To manually specify the order of level of a factor, we'll adjust the data to the order we want.  To do this we can use [fct_relevel](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_relevel.html) either within a graph command or to alter the dataset itself.  

**Example (in graph command):** gf_plot( Y ~ fct_relevel(X , "Level 1", "Level 2", "Level 3"))

**Example (mutate dataset):** Dataset %>% mutate( Var = fct_relevel( Var , "Level 1", "Level 2", "Level 3"))

```{r}
gf_bar(~Year, data = StudentSurvey) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Default Alphabetical Ordering")

gf_bar(~fct_relevel(Year, "FirstYear", "Sophomore", "Junior", "Senior"), data = StudentSurvey) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Adjust Order within Bargraph Command", x = "Year")

StudentSurvey2 = StudentSurvey %>%
  mutate(YearOrdered = fct_relevel(Year, "FirstYear", "Sophomore", "Junior", "Senior"))

gf_bar(~YearOrdered, data = StudentSurvey2) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Ordering after Force Change in Data")

```


## Order by Summary Statistic

In the example below we order the boxplots by the average number of eggs in each bird.  There are a few ways to do this, but one is using the [fct_reorder](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_reorder.html) command in the forcats package.  

**Example (default reorder):** gf_plot( Y ~ fct_reorder(X , Var ), data = Dataset)

**Example (specify median & descending):** gf_plot( Y ~ fct_reorder( X , Var, .fun = median , .desc = TRUE))

```{r}
gf_boxplot(Eggs~Bird, data = Cuckoos, color = ~Bird, show.legend = FALSE) %>%
  gf_labs(x = "Bird Type", title = "Default Ordering of Bird Type")

gf_boxplot(Eggs~fct_reorder(Bird, Eggs), data = Cuckoos, color = ~Bird, show.legend = FALSE) %>%
  gf_labs(x = "Bird Type", title = "Order of Bird Type based on Average Eggs")

gf_boxplot(Eggs~fct_reorder(Bird, Eggs, .fun = median, .desc=TRUE), data = Cuckoos, color = ~Bird, show.legend = FALSE) %>%
  gf_labs(x = "Bird Type", title = "Force Statistic & Descening Order")
```

[This](https://r-graph-gallery.com/267-reorder-a-variable-in-ggplot2.html) post also highlights some options for reordering.  

## Order by Count

Ordering categories by count works slightly differently if there is not an actual variable that counts data in each category.  [This](https://blog.albertkuo.me/post/2022-01-04-reordering-geom-col-and-geom-bar-by-count-or-value/) post was really helpful.  We still use the forcats package, but the function [fct_infreq](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_inorder.html) is what will calculate the frequency for us (so we don't have to create a variable that counts items in a category).

**Example (order by frequency):** gf_plot( ~ fct_infreq(Var), data = Dataset)

**Example (reverse order by freq):** gf_plot( ~ fct_rev(fct_infreq(Var)), data = Dataset)

**Example (only keep n most frequent):** gf_plot( ~ fct_lump_n(fct_infreq(Var), n = 10), data = Dataset)


```{r, include = FALSE}
ufo <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-06-25/ufo_sightings.csv")
```


```{r, fig.height = 7}

gf_bar(state~., data=subset(ufo, country == "us")) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Default Ordering")

gf_bar(fct_infreq(state)~., data=subset(ufo, country == "us")) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Order by Frequency", y = "state")

gf_bar(fct_rev(fct_infreq(state))~., data=subset(ufo, country == "us")) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Order by Frequency (Reverse)", y = "state")

gf_bar(~fct_lump_n(fct_infreq(state), n = 10) , data=subset(ufo, country == "us")) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Order by Frequency (Only keep 10 most frequent)", subtitle = "Lump all the rest in Other Category", y = "state", x = "State")

ufo = ufo %>%
  mutate(TopState = fct_lump_n(fct_infreq(state), n = 10))

gf_bar(~TopState , data=subset(ufo, country == "us"), fill = ~(TopState != "Other"), show.legend = FALSE) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Adjust Dataset for Top 10 States + Other", subtitle = "Change Colors to Highlight Other Category", y = "state", x = "State") 
```


# Polar Coordinates

There may be times where you wish to convert rectangular elements to polar coordinates (to make circles/angles).  One example is the use of polar coordinates to create pie charts.  Below shows a few examples of altnerate ways to adjust a bargraph.

**Convert to Polar:** gf_refine(coord_polar("y", stat = 0))

```{r, warning = FALSE}
data(fly)


gf_bar(~flight_freq, data = na.omit(fly), fill = ~rude_to_recline) %>%
  gf_refine(scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues")) %>%

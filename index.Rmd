# Welcome!

This is meant to be a collection of tips and tricks I have accumulated over years exploring visualizations. Please let me know if something is not working or if I should add something! Always looking to improve this collection.

# Preamble

All refinements are using the ggformula way of graphing. This collection of tips will **not** include a lot of information of creating the basic graph. As such, I am including a few links that may be helpful below.

## List of all ggformula commands

The [ggormula reference page](https://www.mosaic-web.org/ggformula/reference/index.html) includes information and examples on all functions available. Many are types of graphs, but not exclusively.  They also have several articles that walk through ways of graphing in a very visual way.

## Additional Resources

Additionally, Claus O. Wilke has a great resource discussing many [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/) made freely available.

Lastly, the [R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/index.html) gives many examples (and code) of graphs available.
